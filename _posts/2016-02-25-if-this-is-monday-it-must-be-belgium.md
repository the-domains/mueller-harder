# If this is Monday, it must be Belgium

Arriving in Brussels was uneventful. Border control, baggage claim, and customs all went easily. Rather than take the customary train into town, we elected to take a bus and then walk a mile or so in order to see more of the city; though we were hot and tired when we arrived at our Airbnb, it was well worth the effort: we saw interesting modern architecture, beautiful hidden parks with fountains, a street closed by people protesting we-know-not-what, and many people speaking dozens of different languages.

Our accomodations were spacious, convenient, and comfortable. See the view from our windows!
