            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If this is Monday, it must be Belgium</h1><p>Arriving in Brussels was uneventful. Border control, baggage claim, and customs all went easily. Rather than take the customary train into town, we elected to take a bus and then walk a mile or so in order to see more of the city; though we were hot and tired when we arrived at our Airbnb, it was well worth the effort: we saw interesting modern architecture, beautiful hidden parks with fountains, a street closed by people protesting we-know-not-what, and many people speaking dozens of different languages.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b7ef897d-87e9-426e-b915-272a628e7ca9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Who needs baggage, anyway?</h1><p>Unfortunately, the sounds of the revelers leaving the bars and late-night eateries in the area kept waking us up in spite of our weariness from the plane journey, so we didn’t feel as rested in the morning as we’d hoped we would.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Life at 7½ miles above sea level</h1><p>Who knew life could be so comparatively comfortable at 40,000 feet, with the ambient air temperature at -77ºF just outside the window?
